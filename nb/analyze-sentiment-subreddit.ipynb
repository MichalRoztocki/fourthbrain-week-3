The author of the submission is typically unimportant when doing ML tasks related to the text of the posts and comments, and although it's public information, it would still be good to take initiative and hide that data from being shared outside of Reddit. Also, the time the submission was created could be an indication of the time zone the poster lives in."

However, it can also be expected that a lot of the comments in this subreddit would be biased and not necessarily reflective of the market sentiment. One would expect that users who post in the TSLA subreddit probably hold TSLA stock, which would suggest that the amount of positive sentiment would be exaggerated, since a user would probably sell their TSLA stock if they felt negative sentiment towards it and stop following the TSLA subreddit. A more general subreddit, like r/stocks, might prove more useful in getting a less biased view of the TSLA stock, when filtering posts and comments for mentions of TSLA."

Due to this small concentration of 3 relatively active posters, this would make the data biased, as the posts would reflect these few posters' sentiment rather than the market for the stock."
